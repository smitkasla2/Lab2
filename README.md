# Breast Cancer Diagnosis ML Models

## Logistic Regression Model

### Description:
This machine learning model is based on logistic regression. It predicts whether a breast tumor is malignant or benign based on various features computed from a digitized image of a fine needle aspirate (FNA) of a breast mass. The model has been trained and evaluated using the Wisconsin Diagnostic Breast Cancer dataset.

### Features:
- Input features include radius, texture, perimeter, area, smoothness, compactness, concavity, concave points, symmetry, and fractal dimension.
- Target variable: Diagnosis (Malignant or Benign)

### Evaluation:
- Achieved an accuracy of 95% on the test set.
- Evaluation metrics: Accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

### Usage:
1. Load the dataset.
2. Train the model using the provided Python script.
3. Evaluate the model's performance.
4. Make predictions on new data.

## Support Vector Machine (SVM) Model

### Description:
This machine learning model is based on Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm. It predicts breast tumor diagnosis using a different algorithm compared to the logistic regression model. The SVM model is trained and evaluated using the Wisconsin Diagnostic Breast Cancer dataset.

### Features:
- Same features as the logistic regression model.

### Evaluation:
- Achieved an accuracy of 97% on the test set.
- Evaluation metrics: Accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

### Usage:
1. Load the dataset.
2. Train the model using the provided Python script.
3. Evaluate the model's performance.
4. Make predictions on new data.
